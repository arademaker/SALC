SALC is a Labeled Sequent Calculus for ALC, a basic Description Logic
language [1]. This project is about the implementation of SALC in
Maude [2].

We implemented two versions of SALC. A deterministic and a non
deterministic version of SALC. The deterministic version used the idea
of frozen formulas to avoid backtracking in the search of proof
procedure.

The Sequent Calculus implemented here is presented in a series of
papers listed in the bottom of this file. This deduction system for
ALC is part of my thesis.
