 --- 1. opera nas mais externas ou mais internas?
 --- 2. usar lista a direita pode ser melhor, caso contrario tenho que
 ---    garantir que nao existe existencial mais externo
 --- 3. como lidar com regras nao deterministicas? m > n sss inc em um, controle de aplicacoes
 --- 4. new provisos in ALC system rules. Note that we moved R_n and R^n for the right list!!
